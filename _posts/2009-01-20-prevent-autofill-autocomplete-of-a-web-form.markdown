title: Prevent Autofill / Autocomplete of a Web Form
---

If you have a web form and donâ€™t want a users input to be saved by a browser for repeated entry later then you need to employ autocomplete attribte of a form.

The HTML below will give you a simple form that the browser should not prompt the user to save the credentials.

You should note, this is not standards compliant, but it does seem to work in chrome, IE and firefox.
