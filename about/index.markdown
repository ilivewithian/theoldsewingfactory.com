## The Old Sewing Factory

Three developers, one blog, what could possibly go wrong?

[The Old Sewing Factory](http://theoldsewingfactory.com) is a collaborative effort between Mike Bylett, James Timbrell and Rob White. We are all developers working primarily on the web, but will happily tackle almost anything our boss throws at us.

#Who we are were

Mike Bylett ([mbylett](http://twitter.com/mbylett))

Mike is far too busy to fill in this page, he mostly doing, you know, this and that, and some really important and time consuming stuff. It’s tough being Mike.

James Timbrell ([jamestimbrell](http://twitter.com/jamestimbrell))

Akin to Mike, James has yet to lift his massive leathery chimp digits and type anything here, but has got a new born, so we’ll let him off for now.

Rob White ([ilivewithian](http://twitter.com/livewithian))

Sadly Rob is now all on his lonesome, Mike and James are really busy doing things more fun than writing blog posts. Who can blame them?
Anyway, I’m a developer working in Birmingham, UK and this is more of a public scratch pad than a serious, make me famous, blog. If you like what you read let me know, if you don’t, let me, just don’t be mean.
