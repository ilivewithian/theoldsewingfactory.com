<h2>The Old Sewing Factory</h2>

<p>Three developers, one blog, what could possibly go wrong?</p>

<p><a href="http://theoldsewingfactory.com">The Old Sewing Factory</a> <strike>is</strike> was a collaborative effort between Mike Bylett, James Timbrell and Rob White. We are all developers working primarily on the web, but will happily tackle almost anything our boss throws at us.</p>

<h2>Who we <del>are</del> were</h2>

<h3>Mike Bylett (<a href="http://twitter.com/mbylett">mbylett</a>)</h3>

<p>Mike is far too busy to fill in this page, he mostly doing, you know, this and that, and some really important and time consuming stuff. It’s tough being Mike.</p>

<h3>James Timbrell (<a href="http://twitter.com/jamestimbrell">jamestimbrell</a>)</h3>

<p>Akin to Mike, James has yet to lift his massive leathery chimp digits and type anything here, but has got a new born, so we’ll let him off for now.<p>

<h3>Rob White (<a href="http://twitter.com/livewithian">ilivewithian</a>)</h3>

<p>Sadly Rob is now all on his lonesome, Mike and James are really busy doing things more fun than writing blog posts. Who can blame them?
Anyway, I’m a developer working in Birmingham, UK and this is more of a public scratch pad than a serious, make me famous, blog. If you like what you read let me know, if you don’t, let me, just don’t be mean.<p>
